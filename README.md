Little About Myself:
Hi, my name is Mayank Yadav and I'm from Boston, MA. I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I'm currently completing my Masters in Data Science at Boston University and I am set to complete the program in December of 2025. Other then school, some of my hobbies include swimming (used to be a competitive swimmer for 13 years), lifting weights, watching movies, and cooking.
